# AI Generated documentation for `doc-buddy/src/document/generate_code_block.py`
---
The `generate_code_block` function takes two arguments: a string containing source code and a file name.  Its purpose is to wrap the provided code within a Markdown code block, complete with syntax highlighting.  It determines the appropriate language for highlighting based on the provided file name using the `guess_language_for_markdown` function (located in the `guess_language_for_markdown.py` file within the same directory). The function returns a formatted string that includes a heading indicating the file name and the code enclosed within a Markdown code block with the identified language.  For example, if the provided code is "print('hello')" and the filename is "example.py", the returned string will be:

```
# Full listing of example.py
```python
print('hello')
```
```

# Full listing of src/document/generate_code_block.py
```python
from .guess_language_for_markdown import guess_language_for_markdown


def generate_code_block(code: str, file_name: str) -> str:
    """
    Generate a Markdown code block with language syntax highlighting.

    Args:
        code: The source code to be wrapped in a code block.
        file_name: The name of the file, used to determine the language for syntax highlighting.

    Returns:
        A formatted string containing the code wrapped in a Markdown code block with appropriate
        language specification.

    Example:
        >>> generate_code_block("print('hello')", "example.py")
        '\n# Full listing of example.py\n```python\nprint('hello')\n```\n'
    """
    language = guess_language_for_markdown(file_name)

    block = f"\n# Full listing of {file_name}\n"
    block += f"```{language}\n{code}\n```\n"

    return block

```
