# AI Generated documentation for `doc-buddy/src/document/generate_preface.py`
---
The `generate_preface.py` file provides a function to create a preface for documentation files. This preface includes a link back to the table of contents and a header indicating the file being documented.

The `generate_preface` function takes a `Path` object, `file_path`, representing the path to the file being documented, relative to the project root.  It returns a markdown-formatted string containing the preface.

The function first validates the input `file_path`:
1. It raises a ValueError if `file_path` is absolute, as it expects a relative path.
2. It raises a ValueError if `file_path` has fewer than two parts (e.g., "dir/file"). This ensures the path has at least a directory and filename.

The function then constructs the preface string:
1. It adds a link back to the table of contents (`index.md`). The number of "../" segments in the link is dynamically calculated based on the depth of the file within the project directory structure. This ensures the link correctly navigates up to the root directory where `index.md` resides.
2. It adds a level 1 heading (H1) containing "AI Generated documentation for" followed by the project name (obtained from the `config.project_name`) and the provided `file_path`.
3. A horizontal rule (`---`) is appended to visually separate the header from the following content.

Finally, the function returns the complete markdown preface string.
