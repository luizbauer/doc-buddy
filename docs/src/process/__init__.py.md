# AI Generated documentation for `doc-buddy/src/process/__init__.py`
---
This document explains the contents of the `src/process/__init__.py` file within the `doc-buddy` project.  Currently, this file is empty, meaning it contains no code.  In Python, an empty `__init__.py` file in a directory signals that the directory should be treated as a Python package. This allows you to organize your project's code into logical namespaces and modules.

While this file is empty, its presence is crucial for structuring the `process` component of the `doc-buddy` project.  It indicates that the `process` directory is intended to contain modules related to document processing functionalities. As the project grows, you would add modules containing functions, classes, and other code related to document processing within this directory.  These modules can then be imported and utilized by other parts of the `doc-buddy` project.

For example, if you create a file called `extraction.py` within the `process` directory, you could import and use its functions like this:

```python
from process import extraction

extracted_data = extraction.extract_information(document)
```

This highlights the organizational role of `__init__.py`, even when empty. It lays the foundation for a structured and scalable project architecture.
