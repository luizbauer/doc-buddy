# AI Generated documentation for `doc-buddy/src/process/__init__.py`
---
This document describes the `__init__.py` file within the `process` package of the `doc-buddy` project.  Since this file is empty, it serves a specific purpose in Python.

An empty `__init__.py` file signifies that the directory `process` should be treated as a Python package. This allows you to organize modules within this directory and import them using the dot notation (e.g., `from process import some_module`).  While this specific `__init__.py` contains no code, it still plays a crucial role in enabling the `process` directory to function as a package within the larger `doc-buddy` project.  This facilitates a structured and organized codebase.  You can later add initialization code or import specific modules from sub-packages within this file if needed.
