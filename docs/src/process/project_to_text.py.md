# AI Generated documentation for `doc-buddy/src/process/project_to_text.py`
---
This document describes the Python script `project_to_text.py` within the project `doc-buddy`.  This script's purpose is to extract text content from various project file types and consolidate it into a single string. This consolidated text can then be used for further processing, like indexing or searching.

The script utilizes the `extract_text_from_file` function, which dynamically imports and employs specialized extraction functions based on the file's extension.  It supports various file types, including `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, and more. If a specific extraction function isn't available for a given file type, it defaults to a generic text extraction method.

**Function Breakdown:**

* **`extract_text_from_file(file_path)`:**  This is the core function of the script. It takes the file path as input and returns the extracted text content as a string.  The function's logic can be broken down as follows:

    1. **Determine File Extension:** It extracts the file extension using `os.path.splitext()`.

    2. **Dynamic Import:** Based on the file extension, it attempts to import a corresponding extraction function. The naming convention for these functions is `extract_text_from_[extension]` (e.g., `extract_text_from_pdf` for `.pdf` files).  This dynamic import mechanism allows for modularity and extensibility â€“ supporting new file types simply requires adding a new extraction function.  The `try-except` block handles cases where a specialized extractor isn't available.

    3. **Function Execution:** If the specific extraction function is found, it's called with the `file_path` as an argument.  The returned text is then returned by `extract_text_from_file`.

    4. **Generic Extraction (Fallback):**  If no specific extraction function is found, the function attempts to open the file in text mode and read its contents directly. This serves as a fallback for unsupported file types, although it might not be ideal for all cases.  If this fails (e.g., for binary files), it returns an empty string.

**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

Although not explicitly included in the `project_to_text.py` script, the intended usage would likely involve iterating through project files and calling `extract_text_from_file` for each file. The returned text could then be aggregated.  A hypothetical example:

```python
import os
from project_to_text import extract_text_from_file

project_folder = "path/to/project"
all_text = ""

for filename in os.listdir(project_folder):
    file_path = os.path.join(project_folder, filename)
    extracted_text = extract_text_from_file(file_path)
    all_text += extracted_text

# Further processing with 'all_text'
```

**Key Logic and Design Considerations:**

* **Modularity and Extensibility:** The dynamic import mechanism facilitates adding support for new file types without modifying the core `extract_text_from_file` function.
* **Error Handling:** The `try-except` blocks handle cases where specialized extractors are not available or when file reading encounters issues.
* **Fallback Mechanism:** The generic text extraction acts as a fallback for unsupported file types.
* **Dependency Management:**  This script implicitly relies on the presence of other extraction functions (e.g., `extract_text_from_pdf`).  These functions would need to be defined elsewhere in the project and properly imported/available within the script's execution environment.


This script provides a flexible and extensible solution for extracting text from various file types within a project. Its modular design allows for easy maintenance and future additions of support for new file formats.
