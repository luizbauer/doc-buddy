## Documentation for `/var/www/html/scott/doc-buddy/src/ai_provider/ai_provider.py`

This file defines the base class `AIProvider` for interacting with different AI providers to generate documentation for source code files. It leverages the Abstract Base Class (ABC) mechanism in Python to enforce a consistent interface for different AI provider implementations.

**Key Logic and Components:**

1. **Abstract Base Class (ABC):** The `AIProvider` class inherits from `abc.ABC`, making it an abstract class.  This means it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for concrete AI provider classes (e.g., a class for OpenAI, another for Cohere, etc.).

2. **`document_file()` method (Abstract):**  This abstract method is the core functionality of any AI provider.  Subclasses *must* implement this method.  It receives the file name, project path, and the file contents as input and is responsible for sending these to the chosen AI provider's API for documentation generation.  The expected return value is a "document ID" which presumably refers to some identifier for the generated documentation within the AI provider's system.

3. **`generate_prompt()` method:** This method crafts the prompt that will be sent to the AI.  It prioritizes using a custom prompt template defined by the environment variable `AI_PROMPT`.  If this environment variable is not set, it falls back to a default prompt.

    * **Custom Prompt Template:**  If `AI_PROMPT` is defined, its value is used as a template string. Python's `format()` method is then used to substitute the following placeholders within the template:
        * `{file_name}`: The name of the file being documented.
        * `{project_path}`: The path to the project.
        * `{file_contents}`: The content of the file being documented.
    * **Default Prompt:** If no custom template is provided, the default prompt explicitly asks for documentation of the given file, including explanations of functions, classes, and key logic.  It provides the file path and the complete file contents to the AI.

**Example Usage (Conceptual):**

```python
# Assume OpenAIProvider is a concrete subclass of AIProvider
from ai_provider import AIProvider
class OpenAIProvider(AIProvider):
    def document_file(self, file_name, project_path, file_contents):
        # Specific OpenAI API interaction logic here
        # ... makes API call to OpenAI ...
        return document_id

provider = OpenAIProvider()
doc_id = provider.document_file("my_script.py", "/my/project", "print('Hello World')")
print(f"Document ID: {doc_id}")

prompt = provider.generate_prompt("my_script.py", "/my/project", "print('Hello World')")
print(f"Generated Prompt:\n{prompt}")
```

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Flexibility:** The use of an abstract base class and environment variable for custom prompts provides flexibility in integrating with different AI providers and customizing the prompt structure.

* **Error Handling:**  The current implementation lacks error handling.  Production-ready code should include robust error handling (e.g., checking for invalid file paths, handling API errors, etc.).

* **Security:**  Be mindful of potentially sensitive information when including file paths and contents in the prompt, especially when using a third-party AI provider.  Consider sanitizing the input if necessary.

* **Documentation Clarity:** While the provided docstrings are helpful, adding more details about the expected behavior of `document_file()` and the format of the `document_id` would improve clarity.
