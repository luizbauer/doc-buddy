## Documentation for `/var/www/html/scott/doc-buddy/src/util.py`

This module provides utility functions for the `doc-buddy` application, primarily focusing on file handling and initializing AI providers.

### Functions

#### `get_absolute_path(file_path: str)`

This function resolves the absolute path of a given file path. It handles cases where the execution environment might have a custom working directory defined by the `USER_CWD` environment variable.

* **`file_path: str`**: The relative or absolute file path to resolve.
* **Returns**: A `pathlib.Path` object representing the absolute path.

**Logic:**

1. Checks if the `USER_CWD` environment variable is set.
2. If set, it uses this variable's value as the base directory and appends the given `file_path` to it.
3. If `USER_CWD` is not set, it resolves the `file_path` directly from the current working directory.
4. Returns the resolved absolute path as a `pathlib.Path` object.


#### `read_file(file_path: str, dry_run=False)`

Reads and prints the content of a file.  Includes a `dry_run` option for testing.

* **`file_path: str`**: The path to the file to read.
* **`dry_run=False`**:  If `True`, the function only prints the absolute path of the file it *would* read, without actually opening or reading the file's contents. This is useful for debugging and testing.
* **Returns**: `None`. Prints the file content to the console if `dry_run` is `False`.

**Logic:**

1. Calls `get_absolute_path()` to resolve the absolute file path.
2. If `dry_run` is `True`, it prints the absolute path and returns.
3. If `dry_run` is `False`, it attempts to open the file in read mode (`"r"`) with UTF-8 encoding.
4. Prints the entire file content to the console.
5. Handles `FileNotFoundError` and other potential exceptions during file operations, printing informative error messages.


#### `initialize_provider()`

Initializes the AI provider based on the `AI_PROVIDER` environment variable.

* **Returns**: An instance of the chosen AI provider (e.g., `OpenAIProvider`, `GoogleGenAIProvider`, `VertexAIProvider`).  If the `AI_PROVIDER` environment variable is not set or contains an invalid value, the function prints an error message and exits the program.

**Logic:**

1. Retrieves the value of the `AI_PROVIDER` environment variable and converts it to uppercase.
2. Uses a series of `if/elif/else` statements to check the value of `AI_PROVIDER`.
3. Based on the value, it initializes and returns an instance of the corresponding provider class:
    * `GOOGLE-GEMINI`: `GoogleGenAIProvider`
    * `GOOGLE-VERTEXAI`: `VertexAIProvider`
    * `OPENAI`: `OpenAIProvider`
4. If the `AI_PROVIDER` is not set to one of the expected values, it prints an error message and exits the program with a status code of 1, indicating an error.


### Dependencies

The module depends on the following external libraries:

* `os`:  For interacting with the operating system, specifically environment variables.
* `sys`: For interacting with the Python runtime environment, specifically for exiting the program.
* `pathlib`: For working with file paths in a platform-independent manner.
* `ai_provider.open_ai_provider`:  Module containing the `OpenAIProvider` class.
* `ai_provider.google_gen_ai_provider`: Module containing the `GoogleGenAIProvider` class.
* `ai_provider.vertexai_ai_provider`: Module containing the `VertexAIProvider` class.


### Usage

This module is likely imported and used by other scripts in the `doc-buddy` application. The functions provided here handle common tasks like file path resolution, reading files, and initializing AI providers. This helps keep the main application logic cleaner and more organized.


This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `util.py` module.  It explains the purpose of each function and class, along with its parameters, return values, and key logic. It also clarifies the module's dependencies and provides insights into its general usage within the larger application.
