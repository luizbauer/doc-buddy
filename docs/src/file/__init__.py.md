# AI Generated documentation for `doc-buddy/src/file/__init__.py`
---
This document describes the contents of `src/file/__init__.py` within the `doc-buddy` project. This file serves as the public interface for the `file` package, exposing specific functionalities related to file system operations and rendering.

The file uses `__all__` to explicitly define the publicly accessible members of the package. This means only the listed names will be imported when using `from file import *`.

The following functions/classes are exposed:

* **`render_tree(path: str, depth: int = -1, exclude: Optional[List[str]] = None, include: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> str`**: This function generates a textual tree representation of a directory structure starting at the given `path`. The `depth` parameter controls the recursion depth, with `-1` indicating unlimited depth.  `exclude` and `include` parameters allow for filtering files and directories based on their names using glob-like patterns.  The function returns a string containing the rendered tree. This is likely imported from `render_tree.py` within the same package.

* **`render_tree_html(path: str, depth: int = -1, exclude: Optional[List[str]] = None, include: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> str`**: This function is similar to `render_tree`, but generates an HTML representation of the directory tree. This allows for more stylized rendering within web browsers or other HTML-capable environments. It also accepts `path`, `depth`, `exclude`, and `include` parameters with the same functionality as in `render_tree`.

* **`find_files(path: str, pattern: str) -> List[str]`**: This function searches for files within a given directory `path` that match a specified glob `pattern`. It returns a list of file paths that match the provided pattern. This function is imported from `find_files.py`.


By exposing these specific functions, the `__init__.py` file provides a clean and controlled API for interacting with file system navigation, searching, and rendering directory trees in both text and HTML formats.
