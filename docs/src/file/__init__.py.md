# AI Generated documentation for `doc-buddy/src/file/__init__.py`
---
This file, `__init__.py`, located in the `src/file` directory of the `doc-buddy` project, serves as the public interface for the `file` package.  It imports and exposes specific functionalities related to file system operations and rendering directory structures.

The `__all__` list explicitly defines the names that are considered public when importing from this package. This means only the listed functions and classes will be imported when using a wildcard import like `from file import *`.

The following functions are imported and made available:

- **`render_tree`**: This function is imported from the `render_tree.py` file within the same package. Its purpose is to generate a textual, tree-like representation of a directory structure.  Further details about its implementation and parameters would be found in the documentation for `render_tree.py`.

- **`render_tree_html`**: Also imported from `render_tree.py`, this function likely serves a similar purpose to `render_tree` but generates the output in HTML format, making it suitable for web display.  Again, more specific documentation should exist alongside the function definition in `render_tree.py`.

- **`find_files`**: Imported from `find_files.py`, this function is likely designed to search for files within a specified directory or set of directories, potentially with filtering options based on filename patterns, file types, etc.  Details of its functionality should be documented within `find_files.py`.

# Full listing of src/file/__init__.py
```python
# file/__init__.py
from .render_tree import render_tree, render_tree_html
from .find_files import find_files

__all__ = ["render_tree", "find_files", "render_tree_html"]

```
