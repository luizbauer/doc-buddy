# AI Generated documentation for `doc-buddy/src/document/__init__.py`
---
This document explains the `__init__.py` file within the `document` package of the `doc-buddy` project.  This file serves as the public interface for the `document` package, specifying which modules and functions should be readily accessible when importing the `document` package.

The file imports three functions from within the `document` package:

* `generate_toc`: This function is presumed to generate a Table of Contents (TOC) for a document.  Its specific implementation is located in the `generate_toc.py` file within the same package.
* `generate_doc`: This function likely handles the main document generation process.  Its implementation details reside in the `generate_doc.py` file within the same package.
* `generate_footer`: This function is expected to create a footer for the document. Its implementation is located in the `generate_footer.py` file within the same package.

The line `__all__ = ["generate_toc", "generate_doc", "generate_footer"]` is crucial. It explicitly lists the names that should be imported when a user executes `from document import *`. This ensures that only the intended functions (`generate_toc`, `generate_doc`, and `generate_footer`) are made publicly available, preventing the unintended import of other modules or variables within the `document` package.  This promotes a clean and controlled public interface for the package.
